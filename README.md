ansible-dev is a simple CLI tool that integrates with Vagrant to enable users to define, develop,
and test Ansible playbooks, roles, and modules. It allows users to define and manage infrastructure
resources and uses the providers automation engine to provision and run plays.

By utilizing Ansible's playbooks, roles, and modules, developers can automate the deployment of
software applications across multiple hosting providers, reducing the time and effort required to
manage complex infrastructure environments. These playbooks, roles, and modules enable developers to
create, manage, and provision infrastructure resources like virtual machines, load balancers, and
databases.
